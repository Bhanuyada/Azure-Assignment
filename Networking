## Assignment: Azure Networking and Application Services

### Objectives
1. **Create a Virtual Network (VNet) with Subnets**
2. **Set Up Hub and Spoke Architecture with Multiple VNets**
3. **Create and Test Internal and External Load Balancers**
4. **Create and Test Azure Application Gateway**
5. **Set Up a Domain and DNS Server**



### Part A: Create a Virtual Network (VNet) with Subnets

**Objective**: Set up a Virtual Network with two subnets and deploy VMs and SQL DB in the respective subnets.

**Steps**:
1. **Create a Virtual Network**:
   - Navigate to Azure Portal > Create a resource > Networking > Virtual Network.
   - Configure the required fields (Subscription, Resource group, Name, Region, IP Address space).

2. **Create Subnets**:
   - Add two subnets: 
     - **Subnet-1**: Deploy Linux VM and Windows VM.
     - **Subnet-2**: Deploy SQL DB.

3. **Deploy VMs in Subnet-1**:
   - Create a Linux VM in Subnet-1.
   - Create a Windows VM in Subnet-1.

4. **Deploy SQL DB in Subnet-2**:
   - Navigate to Create a resource > Databases > SQL Database.
   - Configure the SQL database to use Subnet-2.

### Part B: Set Up Hub and Spoke Architecture with Multiple VNets

**Objective**: Create four VNets and configure them in a Hub-Spoke architecture. Verify connectivity by pinging VMs.

**Steps**:
1. **Create VNets**:
   - Create the following VNets: 
     - Management VNet (HUB)
     - Production VNet
     - Testing VNet
     - Development VNet

2. **Configure Peering**:
   - Peer each spoke VNet (Production, Testing, Development) with the Hub VNet (Management).

3. **Verify Connectivity**:
   - Deploy a VM in each VNet.
   - From the Management VM, ping the VMs in other VNets to verify connectivity.

### Part C: Create and Test Internal and External Load Balancers

**Objective**: Create an internal and an external load balancer to manage traffic.

**Steps**:
1. **Internal Load Balancer**:
   - Navigate to Create a resource > Networking > Load Balancer.
   - Select Internal and configure backend pool, health probes, and load balancing rules.

2. **External Load Balancer**:
   - Repeat the process, selecting Public for an external load balancer.
   - Configure backend pools, health probes, and load balancing rules.

### Part D: Create and Test Azure Application Gateway

**Objective**: Create an Azure Application Gateway and test its functionality.

**Steps**:
1. **Create Application Gateway**:
   - Navigate to Create a resource > Networking > Application Gateway.
   - Configure the gateway, backend pool, HTTP settings, and routing rules.

2. **Test Application Gateway**:
   - Deploy a simple web application.
   - Access the web app through the Application Gateway to verify functionality.

---

### Part E: Set Up a Domain and DNS Server

**Objective**: Register a domain, set up a server on a VM, and configure DNS.

**Steps**:
1. **Register a Domain**:
   - Navigate to Create a resource > Networking > DNS zone.
   - Register the domain and configure the DNS zone.

2. **Set Up a Server on a VM**:
   - Create a VM and set up a web server (Apache, Nginx, IIS).
   - Configure the domain to point to the VMâ€™s public IP using the DNS zone.

   - Details of VM and SQL DB deployment.

2. **Hub and Spoke Architecture**:
   - Diagrams of VNet peering setup.
   

3. **Load Balancer Setup**:
   - Configuration details of internal and external load balancers.
  
4. **Application Gateway**:
   - Configuration details of the Application Gateway.
  
5. **Domain and DNS Setup**:
   - Domain registration details.
   - DNS zone configuration.
